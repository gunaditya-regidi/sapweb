🙏 **Gau Seva is the highest form of Dharma.**  
At **Saptarushi Charitable Trust**, our Goshala stands as a sacred sanctuary for over **30+ cows**, lovingly nurtured every single day. These cows are not only fed with freshly prepared organic fodder but are also cared for with love, Vedic chants, and prayers.

🌿 Every morning begins with a **gau pooja**, and throughout the day, our team of Veda students and volunteers ensures these divine beings are protected, healed, and honored.

💛 We believe **Gau Raksha** (Cow Protection) is a collective responsibility. That’s why we humbly request all dharmic souls to join hands with us in sustaining this beautiful initiative.

🎁 **Support starts from just ₹2000/- per month**.  
Your contribution goes towards:

- Nutritious feed and clean water  
- Shelter maintenance and medical care  
- Traditional poojas and daily seva rituals  

🛕 Many generous donors already support this cause – now it’s your turn to extend your hand in this divine seva.

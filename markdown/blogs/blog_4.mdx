🕉️ **A Grand Offering of Spiritual Legacy** 🕉️

With immense devotion and the blessings of Jagadguru Adi Shankaracharya’s parampara, **Saptarushi Charitable Trust** has once again successfully completed the divine initiative of **Adi Shankara Vigraha Distribution** on **May 13th, 2025**.

🙏 Over the past **3 years**, this seva has blossomed into a spiritual movement, helping countless devotees reconnect with the essence of **Sanatana Dharma** through the presence of Adi Shankaracharya in their homes and communities.

🏞️ This year’s distribution was conducted with even greater reach and reverence. The vigrahas, intricately crafted and energized with Vedic rituals, were given to **devotees, temples, and gurukulas** across multiple states — each idol serving as a reminder of the Advaita path and the unifying force of Dharma.

🪔 **Our Purpose**  
This initiative is not just about distribution — it’s about **reviving the awareness** of Adi Shankaracharya's philosophy and presence in every household. Every murti reaches a home or temple where **daily prayers, pujas, and learning** continue to honor the Guru’s legacy.

🌿 The event was accompanied by **Vedic chanting, homams, and spiritual discourses** by revered Veda Pandits and our founder, **Dr. M. Madhav Sharma Garu**.

📿 We are humbled to carry this torch for three continuous years and look forward to touching more hearts, homes, and temples in the coming years.

🕉️ **Sankara Smarana... Dharma Prachara!**

At **Saptarushi Charitable Trust**, every initiative is a divine step toward the preservation and promotion of **Sanatana Dharma**. Our programs aim to uplift society through **Vedic tradition**, **selfless service**, and **spiritual enlightenment**. Here's an overview of the sacred services we carry forward under the guidance of our revered founder, **Dr. M. Madhav Sharma Garu**:

### 🕉️ Manushya Yagnam – Service to Humanity

This Yagna symbolizes our **commitment to selfless service**, reaching remote temples and underserved communities with support, sustenance, and seva. From annadanam to rural development, every act is dedicated to the upliftment of fellow beings.


### 🐄 Gosamrakshana – Protection of Sacred Cows

We shelter and care for cows at our **dedicated Goshala**, respecting their divine role in our Vedic tradition. **Daily feed, medical care, and worship** are carried out with devotion, recognizing cows as givers of spiritual and material abundance.


### 🧘 Aarogya Siddhi – Wellbeing Through Rituals

Through special **Vedic rituals and homams**, we support those facing health challenges—physically, mentally, and spiritually. Our regular **Mrutyunjaya homams**, **Ayushya homams**, and **Dhanvantri poojas** are offered for the wellbeing of all.

### 🔱 Deva Yagnyam – Vedic Rituals for Cosmic Balance

These **sacred homams and yagnas** are conducted for the wellbeing of the world, invoking divine blessings from various deities like **Chandi Devi, Ganapati**, and **Lord Shiva**. From temples to private homes, we ensure the sanctity of every ritual.

### 📚 Saptarushi Veda Patasala

Our **Patasala trains young Vedic students (ages 5–12)** in Vedas, Sanskrit shlokas, smartha traditions, and Indian values. With dedicated acharyas, the students undergo years of rigorous training, preparing for a life of dharma and spiritual leadership.

### 🕉️ Shivoham – Spiritual Classes

Weekly spiritual sessions for **adults and youth** are conducted to reconnect individuals with their inner self through **Upanishadic teachings, bhajans, sloka chanting, and discussions** on dharma and ethics. Open to all who wish to walk the path of wisdom.

### 🙏 Pitru Yagnyam – Gratitude to Ancestors

We conduct **Shraddha karmas**, **Tarpanam**, and **Pitru homams** for individuals seeking to honor their ancestors. This offering strengthens family karma and brings peace and continuity to future generations.


### ✨ Vidya Siddhir Bhavathi – Support for Education

We provide **financial aid, scholarships, and guidance** for underprivileged students across India. By blending **modern learning** with **spiritual grounding**, we nurture future citizens rooted in culture and dharma.

Join us in these sacred services. Whether it’s a **donation**, **volunteer opportunity**, or simply spreading the word, **every act of support fuels a divine cause**. Together, let’s preserve our ancient wisdom and create a dharmic future for all.
